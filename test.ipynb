BALANCE OF THE YEAR AND FUTURE CHALLENGES;Although 2020 was an unexpectedly complicated year, it had new opportunities that ;ROVI had been preparing to take advantage of, due to factors such as the marketing of an ;enoxaparin biosimilar, the development of drugs with prospects of being widely used to treat ;complaints, the development of operating synergies and the extension of the scope of the ;value-added manufacturing services with current and potential customers; the launch of ;new products in the market and, particularly in 2020, the manufacturing agreement signed ;with Moderna to provide filling and packaging capacity for hundreds of millions of doses ;of its candidate vaccine outside the United States, acquiring a new production line and ;equipment for compounding, filling, automatic visual inspection and labelling.;Overall, all the foregoing led to an improvement in the company’s financial results: operating ;revenue rose by 10% to 420 million euros (increase of 6.5 percentage points in the EBITDA ;margin to 22.4%) and ROVI’s net profit increased by 55%, to 61.1 million euros.;By business line, prescription pharmaceutical sales rose by 6% to 297 million euros, showing ;growth 4 percentage points higher than the Spanish market in 2020, which, according to the ;consultant IQVIA, rose by 2%. ;The most outstanding products were Neparvis®, indicated for the treatment of adult ;patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure with reduced ejection  fraction, sales of ;which increased to 29.6 million euros, 34% up on 2019; and Volutsa®, a prescription product ;belonging to the company Astellas Pharma and distributed by ROVI, indicated for the ;treatment of moderate to severe storage and voiding symptoms associated with benign ;prostatic hyperplasia, which obtained a sales increase of 7%, rising to 14.2 million euros.;Heparin division sales (low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) and other heparins) rose by ;14% to 209.3 million euros. Sales of these products accounted for 50% of operating revenue ;in 2020, 2% higher than in 2019. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) sales increased by ;14% to 202.8 million euros. Specifically, the enoxaparin biosimilar showed a 25% sales increase, ;rising to 101.4 million euros, and bemiparin sales increased by 5%, also to 101.4 million euros.;In the case of bemiparin, the significant increase in international sales should be highlighted. ;They now represent 33%, due to the increase in transfer prices to some partners as a result ;of the increase in the price of the raw material. For 2021, international sales of bemiparin are ;expected to rise by a high-teen figure.;Lastly, toll manufacturing sales rose by 39% in comparison with the preceding year, ;totalling 91.6 million euros, mainly due to the redirection of the strategy for the activities of ;this business line towards products with higher value-added, where the agreement with ;Moderna for the manufacture of the large scale fill-finish of its candidate mRNA vaccine ;against COVID-19 (mRNA-1273) at ROVI’s Madrid facility was one of the year’s great milestones.;As part of the agreement, ROVI will provide fill-finish capacity for vials by acquiring a new ;production line and equipment for compounding, filling, automatic visual inspection and ;labelling, in order to provide support to the candidate vaccine, with which it was, in principle, ;planned to supply markets outside the United States as of the beginning of 2021, hiring the ;necessary additional personnel for the manufacturing and production operations.;39', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'lista_test.csv', 'row': 37}, lookup_index=0),\n",

Notwithstanding, given the uncertainties ;associated to the development of the COVID-19 pandemic (which ROVI will continue to ;monitor closely), it is not yet possible to make a precise assessment of the impact that the ;pandemic will have on this year.;Over recent years, especially in Spain, public spending on medicines has dropped, but ;the prospects for the next few years are more optimistic. As QuintilesIMS Institute says in ;its report “Outlook for Global Medicines through 2021”, spending on medicines will grow ;between 4% and 7% in the world, mainly driven by new medicines in developed markets ;and higher volumes in emerging markets. According to said document, the total volume of ;medicines consumed all over the world will rise by approximately 3% per year until 2021, a rate ;that is somewhat faster than the population growth rate and demographic changes, driven ;by different factors all over the world.;Globally, the U.S.A. is still the main market worldwide, although it is facing a decrease ;in growth, followed by China, which has been in second position since 2012. The first 20 ;places include nine emerging drug markets, which will continue to be driven by generics, ;which now account for 98% of the market and 78% of spending. The opposite is true of the ;developed markets, where the original brand names still have specific weight in comparison ;with generics.;But the difference between some companies and others will be marked by the capacity to ;provide the market with new and better products. New medicines, which accounted for 20% ;ten years ago, will occupy 35% of the market in 2021. This growth is due to the new scientific ;and R&D developments, such as ROVI’s ISM® technology, and also to their capacity to help ;improve costs and the value that the prescription of these products will contribute.;With all these factors, ROVI expects the growth rate in operating revenue to be in mid-single-;digit figures, excluding the production of Moderna’s COVID-19 candidate vaccine.;40', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'lista_test.csv', 'row': 38}, lookup_index=0),\n",

These R&D expenses were mainly related to carrying out the activities ;necessary to prepare the dossier of Doria® to be filed with the United States authority, the ;U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); the development of Phase I of Letrozole-ISM® ; and ;the development of the new formulation of Risperidone-ISM® to be administered every three ;months.;At the same time, the company remains firm in its support of collaborative research ;through co-operation agreements with other leading benchmark companies in the sector, ;biotechnological companies, universities and public research centres, in order  to combine ;efforts, which results in an increase in scientific, technological, educational and knowledge-;sharing activities. This is a need and requirement of the “knowledge society” and, even at ;times when the economic circumstances are especially difficult, it is necessary to prioritise ;research and development in order to provide an answer to the great challenges in the health ;area and create a dynamic ecosystem of knowledge excellence at national, inter-institutional ;and multidisciplinary levels.;As a result of this commitment, as an agent at the service of society’s needs for the ;prevention and knowledge of certain diseases, in order to improve the health and quality ;of life of patients, ROVI placed its innovation capabilities at the service of the fight against ;COVID-19 in 2020. In this respect, it reached a collaboration agreement with the HM ;Hospitales group to fund a clinical trial that analyses the efficacy and safety of bemiparin ;patients who are in hospital with pneumonia due to COVID-19 and D-dimer higher than 500 ;ng/m, as well as another collaboration agreement with the University of Navarra to carry out ;the randomised, open-label clinical trial to evaluate the effect of prophylactic or therapeutic ;doses of bemiparin in patients with COVID-19 (BEMICOP).;Therefore, this study focuses on an exploratory analysis and evaluation of the safety and ;efficacy of the use of bemiparin, hoping for the results to provide sufficient clinical evidence ;to improve the selection of patients who can receive antithrombotic therapies to improve ;their prognosis and reduce the mortality associated to COVID-19. ;SOLID PATENT PORTFOLIO;At 31 December, 2020, ROVI had an invention portfolio composed of more than 613 dossiers, ;452 of which related to granted patent applications, while 161 were in the examination and ;evaluation phase. The developments of ROVI’s research are addressed mainly at three areas:;• Drug release technologies;• Glycomics;• Multi-layer technologies for use in urethral catheters.;The portfolio of products that the company has under development is mainly focused ;on heparin derivatives and other glycosaminoglycans, as well as the development of new ;controlled-release systems based on the ISM® technology patented by ROVI.

This process is expected to conclude in 2021.;Meanwhile, in November, the journal npj Schizophrenia published of the results of the pivotal ;study PRISMA-3 on the efficacy and safety of Doria® in schizophrenic patients.;The results obtained in this study show that both doses (75 mg and 100 mg once a month) ;have achieved the prespecified primary and secondary efficacy endpoints for treatment of ;patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. The primary efficacy endpoint, the PANSS ;total score (mean difference, CI: 95%), improved significantly with Risperidone ISM® 75 mg ;and 100 mg from the beginning until day 85, with adjusted differences of -13.0 (-17.3 to -8-8); ;(p 0.0001) and -13.3 (-17.6 to -8.9 p<0.0001), respectively.

A balanced use is made of permanent and temporary contracts, the first of ;which cover the activity’s structural needs, while the second are for specific or seasonal ;requirements. This is reflected in a workforce distribution by contract type where permanent ;employees prevail.;At the same time, the company strives to promote the highest degree of inclusion and access ;for differently-abled candidates under equitable conditions, as well as an effective balance ;and equality in the conditions of men and women, a hallmark of its business culture that ;continued to develop in 2020 and will continue to develop in the future.;Finally, for the company’s strategy, it is of vital importance to capture the talent of new, young ;professionals while, at the same time, making use of the experience of veterans. This is shown ;by the balanced distribution of the workforce by age brackets and the encouragement of ;mutual learning between the new professionals, with a new and renewed vision, and the ;most veteran ones, who provide values based on a long career. ;DISTRIBUTION OF EMPLOYEES BY AGE / GENDER ;2020 2019;Men Women TOTAL Men Women TOTALTotal  ;Variation;18-30 years 101 137 238 88 222 310 -23%;31-40 years 198 216 414 179 187 366 13%;41-50 years 225 238 463 210 176 386 20%;51-60 years 125 127 252 116 93 209 21%;>60 years 23 29 52 21 18 39 33%;TOTAL 672 747 1.419 614 696 1.310 8%;47; ;  MenWomenTOTAL: 1-Columna: MenWomenTOTAL.1 2-Datos: [1.011372e+088.822231e+07; 1.982164e+081.791874e+08; 2.252385e+082.101764e+08; 1.251273e+081.169321e+07; 2.329520e+052.118390e+05; 6.727471e+066.146961e+06; Name: MenWomenTOTAL.1, dtype: float64];', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'lista_test.csv', 'row': 45}, lookup_index=0),\n",

EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES AND WORK-LIFE BALANCE;ROVI is convinced of the need to promote real equality in the treatment and opportunities ;of men and women. This is a vital factor to optimise all the company’s talent, eliminating all ;the barriers that conceal or hinder it or prevent it from being fully expressed.;The group is committed to developing and implementing policies that include equal ;treatment and opportunities for women and men, with no direct or indirect gender ;discrimination, and to promote and encourage measures to achieve real equality within ;the organisation, establishing equal opportunities as a strategic principle of its human ;resources policy.;This bet on equality and non-discrimination extends to any other personal characteristic ;(race, beliefs, situation, etc) in all selection, promotion, personal development or ;compensation processes.;In 2020, the first full year of the Equal Opportunities Commission was completed. This ;Commission has the mission of making a diagnosis and monitoring the measures ;implemented to ensure equal opportunities and non-discrimination, as well as fostering ;the inclusion of new actions in these respects.;ROVI carries out an integral activity in this sphere, reflected in the following mechanisms:  ;Equality Plan;In 2020, the ROVI group worked on implementation of an Equality Plan in line with the ;legal framework established by Royal Decree-Law 6/2019. The consultancy firm PwC ;(PricewaterhouseCoopers) and an Equality Commission formed by the Company’s ;main interlocutors took part in preparing said Equality Plan.;However, the publication of Royal Decree 901/2020 of 13 October, which regulated ;equality plans and the registration thereof and amended Royal Decree 713/2010, led to ;substantial changes in the methodology for preparing the plan and in the Company’s ;obligations. Therefore, the Equality Plan has been updated within the framework of the ;new legislation and is expected to be published during the first few months of 2021. ;Code of Ethics;ROVI’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination is also set out in the company’s ;Code of Ethics and the principles that govern training programmes and actions.;Protocol for the Prevention and Handling of Moral and Sexual Harassment.;All employees are obliged to know and respect this Protocol.

In this respect, if there is an obvious imbalance in the composition of the Board ;of Directors, women who meet the necessary requisites and have the profile sought will be ;included among the potential candidates.

To this end, a set of measures to reconcile work and family are in place, adapted to the ;different personal situations that may exist during the life of any employee.;ROVI employees may enjoy the work-life balance measures included in the legislation, the ;enhancements applied through the Collective Agreement of the Chemical Industry and ;others developed by the company itself.;The company is aware that it carries on its activity in different environments (industrial ;production, the marketing area and the industrial structure/office area) with different ;dynamics in working hours and ways of organising working time. In general, ROVI foments ;criteria for organising working time and time off to facilitate the best work-life balance ;possible, as well as allowing parenthood to be exercised responsibly.;In this respect, the following practices are applied:;• Working hours and time off: ROVI has flexible working hours at the beginning and end ;of the working day for office personnel and structural employees in the industrial area. It ;allows changes of shift or day between workers in the industrial area and reductions in ;working hours adapted to the needs of each specific person. Likewise, it offers flexibility in ;the holiday calendars provided that the activity of the employee’s area is compatible.;• Remuneration: ROVI ensures that forming a family is not influenced by factors like loss of ;the normal income for the most vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women. Therefore, ;the company pays a wage supplement that completes the benefit received from the ;Social Security to 100% of the employee’s salary. It also offers salary options, with the ;availability of nursery school vouchers, restaurant vouchers and health insurance within ;its “a la carte” salary proposal. Furthermore, ROVI offers all its permanent employees cover ;by the life insurance policy paid by the company.;• Travel : in order to prevent avoidable travel and trips, the group provides all the personnel ;who so require with a laptop computer, with connectivity to the company’s intranet,  ;and encourages the use of videoconferences and on-line meetings. Likewise, if the work ;performed so permits, the possibility of teleworking is organised for pregnant employees. ;Additionally, at work centres where street parking is difficult, the company makes a series ;of parking spaces available to pregnant women to make it easier for them to get to the ;work centre.;• Disconnection from work: in order for employees to be able to enjoy their time off ;effectively and conserve their personal and family privacy, the company encourages ;practices such as avoiding communication with employees through any channel ;(telephone, e-mail or any other) outside working hours unless there is an urgent, ;unforeseen need that cannot be met otherwise.

The objective is to identify possible deviations, examine any differences that may exist ;and reduce them as far as possible.;To this end, in 2018, the audit firm PricewaterhouseCoopers Auditores, S.L. was engaged ;to perform a limited assurance review of the wage gap indicators by professional group in ;group companies.

The ;Plan included a regular review of wages by gender in order to detect any possible pay ;gap and, if required, take the measures necessary to correct it.

To this end, at the same ;time as ROVI develops them internally, it tries to involve suppliers and subcontractors in the ;adoption of the best corporate social responsibility practices to regulate their activities, in ;accordance with the standards included in the certifications SA-8000, SGE-21 or similar.;In order to ensure and promote all these principles, the company has two mechanisms that ;encourage the adoption of good corporate responsibility practices in its supply chain:;• An obligatory document, “CSR Commitment” is periodically sent to all the group’s ;suppliers and subcontractors, requesting certifications such as the SA-8000 and the ;adoption of good practices. ;• On-site audits, which check that suppliers operate in accordance with national and local ;regulations, there are no important breaches in respect of workplace safety and there are ;no practices that violate the workers’ rights. Among other aspects, the auditors ensure ;that a safe working environment is provided, environmental legislation is respected and ;employees are not subject to abuse or discrimination.;In this respect, in 2020, ROVI adhered to the EcoVadis platform, a tool that allows assessments ;of the corporate social responsibility of Group suppliers to be conducted and areas for ;improvement and corrective actions to be identified. At the time of preparation of this report, ;ROVI and EcoVadis are compiling the first assessment questionnaires and inviting other ;suppliers who are not assessed by this platform to join.;Additionally, an aspect to highlight in supplier evaluations is that, in 2020, the on-site ;audits were replaced by remote (on-line) audits to check that suppliers were operating in ;accordance with the national and local regulations that affect ROVI products.;CSR IN SUPPLIER SELECTION AND RELATIONS;The group has a supplier selection and monitoring policy that includes a list of the criteria ;used to select each type of supplier. The procedure provides for an initial evaluation and ;another periodic evaluation. It is used to draw up a list of approved suppliers, kept by the ;Quality Department.;Moreover, in order to establish a framework for relations with suppliers and creditors that is ;shared by the whole organisation, the Supplier Engagement and Payment Policy requires ;that suppliers with an annual volume of over 100,000 euros must always have a duly signed ;contract, regulates how invoices should be sent and recorded, and sets out the means of ;payment accepted.102-9, 102-10;70', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'lista_test.csv', 'row': 68}, lookup_index=0),\n",
       " Document(page_content='REPORT;20;20: Moreover, the Code of Ethics for Suppliers is the document that establishes that all ;suppliers must respect the protection of fundamental human and labour rights recognised ;internationally. For ROVI it is indispensable to ensure a supply chain that respect the ;corporate social responsibility principles assumed by the group. Thus, one of its main ;commitments is to promote CSR-related values among suppliers and subcontractors of ;goods and services and require the following of them, among other items:;• Abolition of forced labour.;• Abolition of child labour.;• Respect for the right of association and collective bargaining.;• Equal opportunities and non-discrimination.;• The supplier must provide a fair work environment, free of any kind of violence.;• Respect for current legislation on working hours and remuneration.;Over 94% of the ROVI Group’s suppliers operate in countries belonging to the European ;Union and those that carry on their activity outside the European Union enjoy recognised ;prestige in the international community, meaning that supplier non-compliance in respect of ;human rights is considered limited and controlled.;Lastly, regarding the environment, ROVI undertakes to make a joint effort with its suppliers ;and contractors to minimise the impact of their activities on the environment and the risks ;derived for both their own safety and health and those of their workers.;COMMUNICATION WITH SUPPLIERS;In 2020, ROVI continued with its constant effort to maintain adequate communication ;with both new and existing suppliers, in line with its Communication and Transparency ;Policy. In this respect, over the last year, they were informed of the procedures for continual ;improvement implemented to optimise and ensure the process of accounting for invoices, ;placing special emphasis on the management of digital and electronic invoices, in order to ;optimise and accelerate both accounting for and paying the invoices.;In line with the new processes implemented, in 2020, a communication was sent informing ;and/or reminding suppliers of the procedure for sending invoices, giving details of the ;requirements, the incident management process and the procedures aimed to optimise and ;accelerate the process for accounting for the invoices and the process for paying them. This ;communication was sent to all new suppliers and to the existing suppliers where deemed ;appropriate.;In line with Rovi’s Communication and Transparency Policy, which requires suppliers to follow ;the process implemented for digital or electronic invoice management, it was found that, ;in 2020, Rovi’s suppliers continued to use this process, sending their invoices electronically ;to be recorded in the accounts and paid. In comparison with the preceding year, it can be ;confirmed that, although it is only a slight increase, the percentage of supplier adherence to ;the process rose by almost 2% and, therefore, it may be seen to have been well received and ;followed. As an illustration of this, the total volume of electronic invoices managed per year is ;around 34,100.;71', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'lista_test.csv', 'row': 69}, lookup_index=0),\n",
       " Document(page_content='REPORT;20;20: In addition, due to the continual revision and improvement of the company’s tax policies ;regarding tax evasion and the prevention of money laundering, the internal procedure ;concerning double taxation continues to be updated and distributed. In 2020, internal ;training was given to company employees who deal with local and foreign suppliers, in order ;to inform them on the importance of a current residency certificate in relation to the Double ;Taxation Treaty and avoiding any tax risks.;FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION AND BRIBERY;ROVI has a zero tolerance policy, as reflected in its Code of Ethics, towards any activity or ;practice involving bribery or corruption as a way to obtain a decision favourable to the ;company’s interests and, therefore, practices intended to do business using undue means ;will in no case be tolerated. This is complemented by the company’s Anti-corruption Policy, ;which regulates both giving and accepting gifts and must be known and observed by all the ;professionals who work for the ROVI group, as well as the suppliers with whom the group has ;relations. In no case may the acceptance or giving of gifts be used as a subterfuge for bribery ;or the concealment of an unlawful action.;No ROVI employee may offer a third party any type of benefit that is able or intended ;to unlawfully influence the third party’s capacity to adopt objective and lawful business ;decisions. Likewise, ROVI employees are expressly prohibited from accepting any kind ;of corruption or bribery offered by a third party. All interaction with health professionals, ;health organisations, health systems, pharmacies, stores, purchasers, distributors, suppliers, ;commercial partners, public employees or any other third parties in general must be ;governed by lawfulness and ethics and in line with ROVI’s values, company policies, the ;applicable laws and industry standards. ;5.2.  BALANCE OF THE YEAR;In 2020, ROVI worked with approximately 3,030 suppliers from 33 countries. The weight of ;Spanish suppliers for the company should be highlighted, since they account for 80% of the ;total, while more than 94% operate in countries belonging to the European Union.;Over recent years, the opening of new subsidiaries in the main European markets has ;stimulated the engagement of local suppliers to provide services. ROVI now has, therefore, a ;large number of service providers in Germany, Portugal, France, United Kingdom, Italy and ;Poland.;The average payment period to suppliers in 2020 was 52.52 days, in accordance with the ;maximum legal periods established in Law 17/2010, amended by Law 11/2013.;72', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'lista_test.csv', 'row': 70}, lookup_index=0),\n",

ROVI obtained a rating of 21.8 points, which places the Company in a medium-low risk ;position in respect of suffering material financial impacts.

Specifically, the following were donated:;• 241,000 surgical masks to 154 hospitals.;• 48 portable ultrasound machines to 41 hospitals.;• 2,345 stethoscopes to 90 hospitals. ;• 2,710 pulse oximeters to 106 hospitals.;Furthermore, as described in the section “Occupational health and safety”, when the ;pandemic began, the measures necessary to avoid the risk of contagion among employees ;were implemented, with different supporting initiates to contribute to the de-escalation in ;the company in all the waves of the pandemic.;COMMITMENT TO TRAINING;ROVI focuses its training commitment on students  with a view to their entering the job ;market with guarantees. To this end, it co-operates with different higher-educational bodies ;and holds 85 agreements with educational centres, including universities, secondary schools, ;professional and official training centres and business schools all over Spain.;At the same time, it supports the continuous development of its own professional, favouring ;and fostering their continuing education to learn new skills or assume responsibilities, ;making them grow in their professional career within the company itself.;All the details of both internal training and the company’s work with scholarship-holders and ;its co-operation with educational centres may be consulted in the Human Resources section ;of this report.;75', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'lista_test.csv', 'row': 73}, lookup_index=0),\n",

For this reason, over recent years, it has been carrying on ;intensive research activity with the goal of fomenting the prevention and knowledge of certain ;diseases, in order to improve patients’ health and quality of life.;COVID-19 has shown the importance of this effort, since it has been necessary to get down to ;work and, against the clock, generate information and scientific evidence regarding the diseases, ;its effects and possible therapeutic approaches. In this respect, ROVI reached a collaboration ;agreement with the HM Hospitales group to fund a clinical trial to analyse the efficacy and safety ;of bemiparin in patients who are in hospital with pneumonia due to COVID-19 and D-dimer ;higher than 500 ng/m. Attention should also be drawn to another collaboration agreement, with ;the University of Navarra, to carry out a randomised, open-label clinical trial to evaluate the effect ;of prophylactic or therapeutic doses of bemiparin in patients with COVID-19 (BEMICOP).;Something that has also been found to be essential is an idea that ROVI had been defending ;for some time: support to collaborative research. The formation of research consortiums is a ;need and requirement of the “knowledge society” and, therefore, for many years, ROVI has been ;striving to maintain collaboration agreements with other leading benchmark companies in the ;sector, biotechnology companies, spin-offs, universities and public research centre, thus showing ;its commitment to the creation of a dynamic ecosystem of knowledge excellence at national, ;inter-institutional and multidisciplinary levels.;Sharing knowledge is another important pillar of research and ROVI considers it essential to ;share scientific advances with the rest of society. Due to the pandemic, numerous events, ;conferences and congresses were cancelled, limiting the group’s activity in this respect, although ;it has continued to sponsor some initiatives of this nature. ;ECONOMIC VALUE GENERATED AND DISTRIBUTED ;(million euros) 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016;Economic value generated 421.1 382.5 304.8 277.4 270.8;Economic value distributed  ;Shareholders 21.4 9.8 4.5 6.0 9.1;Suppliers 228.6 219.2 172.7 154.7 153.5;Society 11.5 2.6 -1.2 0.3 1.8;R&D 23.8 29.3 32.4 28.3 17.5;Employees 74.4 72.5 70.2 64.0 60.5;Providers of capital 2.1 0.8 0.8 0.9 0.5;Amortisation & depreciation 19.6 18.6 12.0 11.5 11   201-1;76; ;  Unnamed: 0: A-Contexto: (million euros) 2020 2019 2018 2017 B-Contenido:1-Columna: 2016.0 2-Datos: [Economic value generated 421.1 382.5 304.8 277.4270.8; Shareholders 21.4 9.8 4.5 6.0 9.1; Suppliers 228.6 219.2 172.7 154.7153.5; Society 11.5 2.6 -1.2 0.3 1.8; R&D 23.8 29.3 32.4 28.3 17.5; Employees 74.4 72.5 70.2 64.060.5; Providers of capital 2.1 0.8 0.8 0.9 0.5; Amortisation & depreciation 19.6 18.6 12.0 11.5 11.0; Name: 2016.0, dtype: float64];', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'lista_test.csv', 'row': 74}, lookup_index=0),\n",
